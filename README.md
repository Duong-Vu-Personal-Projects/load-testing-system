# Performance Testing and Bottleneck Detection Web Application

## Project Overview

An automated web platform for end-to-end performance testing (load-testing), results visualization, and AI/ML-powered bottleneck detection for web applications.

## Objectives

Build a complete web platform that automates the entire performance testing (load-testing) process, visually presents results, and automatically detects application bottlenecks using AI/ML algorithms.

## Functional Requirements

### Load-Testing Scenario Management
- Automatically generate load-testing scenarios based on log analysis or historical data
- Create, edit, delete, and store load-testing scenarios according to user needs

### Automated Test Execution & Management
- Run performance tests automatically and according to preset schedules
- Web interface to monitor, manage, and cancel test runs

### Performance Monitoring Dashboard
- Real-time visualization of key performance metrics (latency, throughput, error rates, CPU, RAM)
- Compare load-testing results between different sessions

### Automated Bottleneck Detection & Alerts
- Use AI algorithms to detect system bottlenecks (Anomaly Detection)
- Real-time alerts when bottlenecks appear through interface and email notifications
- Provide AI-based suggestions on causes and performance improvement solutions (using LLM APIs like GPT)

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend
- ReactJS, Ant Design, ChartJS/Recharts

### Backend/API
- Java Spring Boot
- Python (optional Django)
- Node.js (optional)

### Load-testing Tools
- Apache JMeter, Locust, or K6

### Database & Logging
- Elasticsearch (ELK Stack)
- PostgreSQL/MongoDB

### AI/ML Components
- Isolation Forest, Autoencoder (Anomaly detection)
- OpenAI GPT API (analysis and solution recommendations)

### Monitoring
- Prometheus, Grafana

### Deployment
- Docker, Kubernetes

## Expected Deliverables

- Complete web application source code, clearly managed on GitHub/GitLab
- Effective and user-friendly dashboard for visualizing test data and bottleneck detection
- Detailed documentation on system architecture, installation, and usage instructions
- Detailed report on the AI models used, evaluation of effectiveness and actual accuracy in bottleneck detection

## Evaluation Criteria

- Quality, stability, and scalability of the web application
- User-friendly interface and good user experience
- Degree of automation and practical effectiveness of the testing and bottleneck detection system
- Accuracy and efficiency of AI/ML algorithms
- Quality of technical documentation, deployment guides, and result reports
